Description: An R package to construct phylogenies for very large numbers of
    sequences. This package currently implements an interface to high
    performance computing environments to run the ExaML program. Shell scripts
    are generated that can be either run directly, or submitted to an HPC
    system. At present, cmd.hpccaller provides an interface to the Imperial
    College CX1B high performance system that runs PBS (portable batch system)
